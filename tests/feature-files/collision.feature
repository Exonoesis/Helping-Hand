Feature: Collision
    Scenario: Collision tiles should be invisible.
        Given a Tiled map called collision_test.tmx,
        When the Tiled map is loaded,
        And the Tiled map has been converted to a rendered map,
        Then there are 4 collision tiles in the rendered map.
        And rendered tile 1,0,2 is invisible.
        And rendered tile 0,1,2 is invisible.
        And rendered tile 2,1,2 is invisible.
        And rendered tile 1,2,2 is invisible.

    Scenario: Collision tiles are being found.
        Given a Tiled map called collision_test.tmx,
        When the Tiled map is loaded,
        And the collision tiles are collected,
        Then tile 1,0,2 is a collision tile in the collection.
        And tile 0,1,2 is a collision tile in the collection.
        And tile 2,1,2 is a collision tile in the collection.
        And tile 1,2,2 is a collision tile in the collection.
